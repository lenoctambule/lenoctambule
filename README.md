### Hi, I'm Ravaka. Just a tech :sunglasses:

👋 I am a generalist software developper.
- I'm highly interested and invested in the study of 🌪️ nonlinear dynamical system 🌪️ and applying this knowledge to help us think, decide and act 🌍 sustainably 🌍.
- I'm currently working on a novel causal inference method designed to address the difficulty of determining causal relationships within systems composed of more than two components.
