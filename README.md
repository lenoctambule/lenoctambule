### Hi, I'm Ravaka. Just a tech :sunglasses:

I am a generalist software developper.
I'm highly interested and invested in the study of nonlinear dynamical system and applying this knowledge to help us think, decide and act sustainably. I'm currently working on a novel causal inference method designed to address the difficulty of determining causal relationships within systems composed of more than two components.
